Guide the snake to eat the food, grow longer, and challenge your skills as the game speeds up!


Classic Snake gameplay with modern design.
Dynamic difficulty: the snake speeds up as it grows longer.
Simple and intuitive controls.
Restart functionality for continuous fun.

    ---The goal is to eat as much food as possible without crashing into the walls or the snake's own tail.
    ---The game ends when the snake crashes.
